## Method Newton

In the mathematical field of numerical analysis, a Newton polynomial, named after its inventor Isaac Newton,[citation needed] is an interpolation polynomial for a given set of data points. The Newton polynomial is sometimes called Newton's divided differences interpolation polynomial because the coefficients of the polynomial are calculated using 

## Method Lagrange

In numerical analysis, Lagrange polynomials are used for polynomial interpolation. For a given set of points {\displaystyle (x_{j},y_{j})} {\displaystyle (x_{j},y_{j})} with no two {\displaystyle x_{j}} x_{j} values equal, the Lagrange polynomial is the polynomial of lowest degree that assumes at each value {\displaystyle x_{j}} x_{j} the corresponding value {\displaystyle y_{j}} y_{j} (i.e. the functions coincide at each point). The interpolating polynomial of the least degree is unique, however, and since it can be arrived at through multiple methods, referring to "the Lagrange polynomial" is perhaps not as correct as referring to "the Lagrange form" of that unique polynomial.
